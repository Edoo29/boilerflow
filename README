**Manutention in progress** \
I'm currently working on:

- MacOS and Linux support
- React & Nextjs boilerplates
- More extras support like CSS frameworks

This project is still in alpha version, so it can crash sometimes.
Please be patient, a lot of things are coming!

# Boilerflow

This CLI was made in Python by me.

This works only on Windows 10/11, but I'm currently working for the MacOS and Linux version!
